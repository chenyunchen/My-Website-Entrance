===================

Practice for node.js and express framework

Have fun with fontend website too, This is my Web Fundaments final project :)

This website use these cool project~

```
Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com
Fontawesome  http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Animate.css http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
```

The background is fun with html tag <canvas> 
You can find the detail on the public/javascript/bg.js

```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.fillStyle = "rgba("+br+","+bg+","+bb+", 0.05)";
```

transparency = 0.05
I use transparency to renew the background.
this is the more easy to change the background and make it look nature XD~

If you have interesting in canvas,watch more detail on w3c and have fun.
